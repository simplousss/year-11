  <h2>Final Outcome</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              im planing to make a 3d male pirate charcter with idle, walking and running animations with a deatailed body structure with big mucles
            </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <div class="split-box">
    <p class="a">
      Aesthetics is making sure your outcome looks good and well structured while still feeling good. This is important for a 3D charcter because it ensures a good experiance for the users. 
    </p>
    <p class="b">
      I addressed this by:
<br>
      im going to make my 3D low poly character looks Aestheticly pleasing by smoothing the charcters body making it less blocky, adding nice looking colors and a face.
</p>
</div>
    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <div class="split-box">
    <p class="a">
      Functionality is going back and making sure your outcome works as intended, and if its not fixing it. This is important for a 3D charcter because it ensures a good experiance for the users. 
    </p>
    <p class="b">
      I addressed this by:
<br>
      im going to make sure my 3D low poly character is properly functional by double checking the code for the animations making sure they work and ensuring a good result with lots of testing.
</p>
</div>
    <h2>Usability</h2>
    <div class="split-box">
    <p class="a">
      Usability is making sure your outcome is fairly easy to use and is aleast understandable to everbody. This is important for a 3D charcter because it ensures a good experiance for the users. 
    </p>
    <p class="b">
      I addressed this by:
<br>
      I will ensure the basic usablity standards by getiing feedback from my peers over the top of my exesive checking and correcting to make sure the animations run smoothly and as intended.
